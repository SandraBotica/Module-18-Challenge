## This visualisation aims to inform CitiBike and City Officials about usage of bikes in NYC.

### There are 2 parts to this story. 

### Part 1 - First 4 Dashboards.

## What can we learn about ridership trends based on the **Total Rides** and **Average Trip Duration** per Year, Season, Month, Day of the Week and Hour of the Day.
### - Features of Dashboard 1 - "Total Trips" (Year/Month/Season)

 - It shows the number of Total Rides..
 - The small bar chart shows the percentage of Total Rides for each year. 
 - If you select a year on this bar chart the horizontal bar chart below will display the total rides per month for that year.
 - Months have been colored according to season and display the seasonal variations in number of rides.
 - As can be expected a seasonal wave of total rides appears from largest to smallest: Summer, Autumn, Spring then Winter. 
 - Select a season to see the associated months and if ridership is increasing or decreasing.

 - Citibike can use this Dasboard to monitor growth trends and help ascertain if they have enough bikes and stations to accomodate this change in ridership. Citibike may also need to meet with City Officials to discuss Town Planning to accomodate this potential growth.
 
### - Features of Dashboard 2 - "Total Trips" (Hour of the Day, Day of the Week, Season)

 - Shows Total Rides per Day of the Week and Hour of the Day, based on the Season.
 - Select any Hour of the Day on a Seasonal line graph.
 - The total rides for that Hour will appear for each Day of the Week in the line graph below.

 - Peak hours are 8am and 3-7pm. 
 - Rides dip after 8am, as one can assume most people have just arrived to work.
 - Rides rise from 10am until 6pm.
 - Few rides between 12pm to 5am.

 - Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by Thursday and Monday have highest number of rides.
 - Saturday and Sunday have less rides and more occur later in the day, especially during Summer and Autumn. 

 - 11pm-4am more rides Sat/Sun. 
 - 5-9am more rides Mon-Fri.
 - 10am-2pm slightly more rides on Sat/Sun.
 - 3-4pm minimal variation for day of the week.
 - 5-10pm fewer rides Sat/Sun.

 - Citibike can consider data from these 2 dashboards when planning bike or station safety checks and maintenance, such as off-peak periods. Citibike may also have to adjust frequency of service and maintenance during peak periods and choose the best time of day or day of the week so maximum number of bikes are available for potential business.
 
 - Citi officials will also find this data useful in planning safety/awareness campaigns leading into peak seasons, months, days of the week or hours of the day to make the public aware of the increased ridership in the City of NY.

### - Features of Dashboard 3 - "Average Trip Duration" (Year and Month)

 - The vertical bar graph shows the average trip duration in seconds for each year and the percentage of decline from one year to the next.
 - Average Trip Duration is declining.

 - Select a year on the vertical bar graph and it's associated month and average trip duration with percentage decline will appear.

 - Interesting data from the original 2 year analysis.
 - Why such long rides in June 2021 & Jan 2022?
 - June 2021, Lowest covid positive rates and International travel announced to return July 1. Summer excitement, riding around NYC.
 - January 2022, Omicron spread, reduced train services announced Dec 26 due to staff illnesses. People having to find alternative travel to and from home, work etc. Ridership increased.

### - Features of Dashboard 4 - "Average Trip Duration" (Day of the Week, Month, Season)

 - Select any Day of the Week on one Seasonal line graph.
 - The average trip duration for that Day of the Week will appear for each Month(Year) for that season in the horizontal bar chart below.

 - Summer, followed by Spring and Autumn have riders taking longer rides then in Winter.

 - Citibike can use the data from dashboard 3 and 4 to monitor average trip durations and whether the frequency of service on bikes is required less often if declining in length of rides.
 

### Part 2 - Last 2 Dashboards.

## What can we learn about Stations based on **Total Rides** per Station and if the rider is a member or casual rider and what type of bike they are riding.

### - Features of Dashoboard 5 and 6 - "Popular Start and End Stations"

 - These 2 Dashboards have a horizontal bar graph of the 10 Start and End Stations with the highest number of Total Rides for the 2 years. 
 - Select one station from the bar graph and see the two bubble charts below for the number of Total Rides riden by a casual or member rider and what type of bike they are riding.

 - There are more members than casual riders using Citibikes.
 - There are more classic bikes used when compared with electric-bikes.

 - Citibike and City officials may find this data useful in designing marketing strategies. Take for example, advertising near stations with fewer casual riders and offering discounts or incentives to local businesses to utilise this service. 
 - They may also consider offering discounts in areas of the city where electric-bikes are used less often so as to increase total ridership.
 - Citi Officials could monitor usage and convert it to a carbon reducing tally for a ZIP CODE, which then might be rewarded with discounts for casual or member fees.

### - Features of Dashboard 7 - "Total Trips per Start Stations and End Stations"

 - 2 maps have been provided for the Total Rides per Start and End Station.
 - The larger the size and the darker the marker indicates a higher number of Total Trips at a Station.
 - Select a range in the list of total rides to see where these Stations are located. Move the slider and total rides within the range appear on the map.

 - I recommend starting by selecting the largest total trips and progress through each listed group, decreasing in Total Trips and notice the stations change in location away from Sth/West of Central Park Manhattan Island.

 - Citibike may find thi information informative in their planning by recommending to Citi Officials more Stations and bikes being available in high usage areas.
 - Citibike could also use this data to work with Citi Officials in designing campaigns that encourage use of CitiBikes, where ridership is lower.

### I hope you enjoy exploring this visualisation.

### It was fun to create!
